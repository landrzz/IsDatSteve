ONE STEVE TO RULE THEM ALL

its just a fun little project made with Xamarin.Forms, Prism, DryIOC and some other cool tools.
(There's an Android component attached but I did not develop this app for use on that platform.)
Uses features like haptic feedback, image caching via ffimageloading, and machine recognition utilizing Apple's CoreML and 
an exported model designed with Azure's Cognitive Image Services.
